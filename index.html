                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>
                    My ultimate mission in 2022 is to learn web development and find a job as a
                    developer. May be as a
                    junior one. That's not a problem. The star is important to me.</p>

                <h4>Vision</h4>
                <p>
                    I will first finish the Complete Web Development course of Programming Hero by Jhankar Mahbub. After
                    that I will try to practice as much as possible and build some projects to enrich my portfolio. I
                    believe that will help me getting a JOB position of Junior Web Developer!

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>
                    As I previously stated that my initial goal is to get a job so that I can learn in a real
                    environment and start my career as a Web Developer. Gradually I want climb to the top of the Web
                    Development career hierarchy.

                As a begginer sometimes I struggle to write or understand very simple codes. But as my instructor said
                that this is very normal and happens to everyone who starts coding for the first time, I am taking this
                normally.
